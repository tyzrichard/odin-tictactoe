# odin-tictactoe
A Tic-Tac-Toe browser game under the Odin Project which touched on using Factory Functions.
and it works!

Ok, I'm gonna keep this short (lazy to write an entire essay aight). Features:
- Plays Tic-Tac-Toe like you'ld expect it to
- Uses a ton of functions yes
- Has a scorebar that shows the current score
- An edit button to change the players' names,
- and a reset button to reset EVERYTHING except the names, little QOL feature there
- Also scales dynamically!
